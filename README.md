# CustomerPay
Program allows for customers payments and amounts owed to be updated.

*MYCSTP holds all of the custermer data.*

This program sequantially processes the GTAPAYP file and randomally retrieves the appropriate records. It subtracts the amount payed from the amount owed and updates the master record (MYCSTP).

Learned:
1. Copy and rename file from one location to a different using 5250 command line.
2. Change legacy date to native date and vice versa.

PS: Programes needed to create code and compile either IBM RDi or 5250 Emulator.
